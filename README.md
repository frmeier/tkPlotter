tkPlotter
=========

Primitive tool to make some plots of a simplified tracker

You will need a recent version of root to use it. Use he content as compiled macros in root.

Usage:
- Have root installed
- Clone this repo
- In root do the following (ok, can be done more elegant, but works):
- ```.L det.C+```
- ```.L tracker.C+```
- ```.L demo1.C+```
- ```demo(N)``` where N is the number of the strawman you want the plots for
